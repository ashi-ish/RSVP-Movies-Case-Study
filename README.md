# 🎬 **RSVP Movies SQL Case Study**  

## 📝 **Project Overview**  
This case study focuses on **practicing SQL querying concepts** through an **end-to-end database analysis** of RSVP Movies. The goal is to **design, query, and analyze a relational database system** using MySQL. This hands-on project provides **real-world experience** in working with **OLAP vs OLTP systems, database design, joins, and set operations**.  

## 🎯 **Objectives of the Case Study**  
✔ Understand **database design & normalization** for a structured RDBMS  
✔ Create **databases, tables, and relationships** in **MySQL Workbench**  
✔ Perform **data querying** using **SQL commands**  
✔ Implement **Joins, Set Operations, Aggregations, and Filtering**  
✔ Gain hands-on experience in **SQL-based analysis of the movies dataset**
